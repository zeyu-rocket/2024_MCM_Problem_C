Sample1:Observing the provided data, some problems and corresponding processing are found as follows. Referencing the Wordle Status and we discovered that there were some erroneous data in the attachment. These included incorrect word lengths, spelling errors, and incorrect values in Number of reported results, among others. For instance, the word at 314 was mistakenly written as "tash". Additionally, the Number of reported results at 529 was erroneously recorded as 2569. To address these issues, we conducted data cleaning to minimize errors , and to enhance the quality and accuracy of our data . The following are the results of our data cleaning process.During our data inspection, we identified instances where the sum of the proportion of attempts for certain days did not equal 100% due to statistical errors. To address this issue, we recalculated the proportions for each day so that the sum would be exactly 100%. By doing so, we aimed to reduce errors associated with the same variable on different days and to improve the accuracy of our model.Our processing result is ‚Ä¶.
Sample2:In addressing task 1, it is dispensable to analyze the attributes of words related to the prob- lem and collect relevant data.The possible factors include the frequency, the breadth of the usage in different fields, the number of different letters in words and parts of speech. In general Nat- ural Language Processing (NLP), there are 36 commonly used parts of speech[2], of which we selected 18 types relevant to this task as shown in Table 1. To process missing values, abnormal values and repeated observations in the original data set, we apply a series of data processing methods: data cleaning, establishment of dummy variables for discrete variables, logarithmic transformation of the number of reports and set-up of new attributes. The four steps enable the elimination of extraneous information and facilitate the identification and extraction of relevant information from the dataset. Step 1: In the stage of data cleaning, we use Python to check for missing, outlier and du- plicate values. By measuring length of words, we check for empty or unusually long values. We find that there are no empty values but three outliers: ‚Äùtash‚Äù, ‚Äùclen‚Äù and ‚Äùrprobe‚Äù. After searching and comparing online, we correct those words as ‚Äùtrash‚Äù, ‚Äùclean‚Äù and ‚Äùprobe‚Äù. Fur- thermore, using the ‚Äùduplicate()‚Äù method, we check for duplicate values with no duplicate value found. Step 2: To make the discrete variable of part-of-speech easier to be processed by the model, we construct 17 dummy variables to convert the discrete variable into binary variables. Step 3: We plan to use a time series model to predict the number of reports on March 1, 2023. In these types of models, it is crucial to eliminate heteroscedasticity in the data. Taking the logarithm of the data does not change its nature or correlation, but it compresses the scale of the variable. By shrinking the absolute values of the data, it is easier to eliminate the problem of heteroscedasticity. Therefore, we logarithmically transform the reported quantity. Step 4: To comprehensively explore the influence of various word attributes on reported Hard-Mode-played scores, we further extract the attributes of words and establish several new variables. This will be elaborated in Section 3.4. 

Sample3:While examining the dataset we found two types of outliers in the dataset: word lengths that are not 5 and an unusually low number of total reports. Details of the anomalous data are as follows. To ensure the correctness of the data, we chose to use the removal of anomalous data instead of correction and interpolation. For KNN regression and classification, to avoid the effect of magnitudes on calculat- ing the distance between observations, we normalized the data according to the following equation. where ùë• is i-th observation of criteria j, ùëã is all the observations of criteria j, ùë•‚àóis ùëñùëó ùëó ùëñùëó normalized data. The normalized data had a mean of 0 and a variance of 

Sample4:The data we use includes the data files given as Problem C Data Wordle.xlsx This file gives nearly all the information we need for solving the problem. But before using it, the data needs to be preprocessed. Firstly, we need to exclude outliers in the data set, that is, remove the points where the percentage of scores reported that were played in Hard Mode (hereinafter referred to as Hard Mode Percentage) is too far away from the other data. When making a scatter plot with a smooth line of the Reported results number, Number in hard mode, and Hard Mode Percentage concerning time, we can easily find the existence of outliers, which are marked with red dots in the following figures. Using the method of rolling boundary statistics, select the Hard Mode Percentage for 30 days before and 30 days after a certain day as the sample group, then construct the rolling interval according to the following equation: If the Hard Mode Percentage for that day falls outside this interval, it is an outlier. Ac- cording to this method, we tested the data set and obtained 4 outlier points. After elimi- nating the outliers, we used the linear interpolation method to complete the original data to obtain a more stationary data set. In addition, we also found that there are spelling errors in the data set. For example, some given words only contain four letters, which contradicts the game‚Äôs rule of 5 letters. We removed the sample data with misspelled words to ensure the validity of the data. All data samples to be processed and processing results are shown in the table below. 

Sample5:By reviewing the given data, we found that there are no missing values, but there are
five outliers. One of them does not exist and two of them has less than 5 letters, we
deleted these three rows of data due to the difficulty of obtaining the true values of these
words. The two remaining outliers are caused by data entry errors. In order to avoid an
excessive reduction in the amount of data, we changed them by combining the previous
and later data as well as the semantics of them. In addition, the sum of the percentages
in the original data are all in [98%, 102%], which is not much different from 100%, so
they are reasonable and do not need to be processed. In summary, the preprocessing of
the raw data is summarized in Table 2.

Sample6:Since we can only use the official COMAP dataset ‚ÄôProblem_C_Data_Wordle.xlsx‚Äô, and the given data is obtained by mining Twitter, there is a possibility of data anoma- lies, so we pre-processed this part of the data before building the model. 

sample7:After statistics and processing of data, it was found that there were two kinds of errors in the
sample data: The first one is the lexical error, including length inconsistency, null character, and
other problems. We do the correction based on oÔ¨Écial twitter as shown in Table.2; The second one
is the data error. The total number of scores reported on January 30th, 2022 is an outlier because
of its lack of magnitude. So we looked back at oÔ¨Écial twitter on that day and found the correct
number is 25,569
